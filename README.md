# H-Keys

H-Keys ~ is a Simple Script for adding Key's to Your Termux.
While using termux when we have to use keys like 'Ctrl' ,  'Alt' or 
'Up' or 'Down' and 'Arrow' key we use Touch keyboard which comes in by default with termux app.
But in that touch keyboard, we don’t get  'Arrow' key and Function key (F1,F2...) as well as other keys which we can see on a normal keyboard. 
To access extra keys while using termux, a lot of users, using  the hacker’s keyboard. 
In my opinion, it is just a waste of storage.
This Script Will Make you easier 
you dont want to install any apps, just run the Script in termux and choose what keys you want . Done...

## Advanced Tips

Use two-finger pinch to adjust font size. Termux use combination with volume keys to emulate some functions in shell:
* `VolDown+C`: `Ctrl+C`, send SIGINT to interrupt current process
* `VolDown+D`: `Ctrl+D`, EOF logout current session
* `VolDown+E`: `Ctrl+E`, move cursor to end of line in shell
* `VolDown+L`: `Ctrl+L`, clear terminal screen
* `VolDown+Z`: `Ctrl+Z`, send SIGTSTP to suspend current process

You can `VolUp+Q` to bring up an extra key bar, but you can also use combinations below:
* `VolUp+W/A/S/D`: Move cursor up/left/down/right
* `VolUp+E`: ESC
* `VolUp+T`: TAB
* `VolUp+Digits`: F1-F9, F10 is 0
* `VolUp+L`: pipe character "|"
* `VolUp+H`: tilt character "~"
* `VolUp+U`: underscore "_"
* `VolUp+V`: Volume control
